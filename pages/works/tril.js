      <h1>iOS App | Tril</h1>
      <p>Tril is a recommendations matrix developed by your own trusted networks, where you can share, discover, store and access detailed info about music, movies, TV shows, bars, restaurants and more.</p>
      <p>Tril offers you a space to discover cultural content without the influence of algorithms or ads. Instead, you have access to quality content curated for you by the people in your life who's opinion you already trust and the ability to further expand your network of influencers based on their taste.</p>
      <p>I was lucky to be Tril’s UX-UI designer from its version 1.0. Together with the team we designed and redefined the product based on our interaction with users.</p>

      <h1>Stage 1 | Definition</h1>
      <p>Even though we saw in <strong>Mixpanel</strong> that the users were active on Tril when it came to collect their favorites things, other events such as re-tril o save didn’t have good metric. We decided to re-think the experience of discovering new things. This goal was intent to help us in improving our retention numbers too.</p>

      <h1>Stage 2 | Research</h1>
      <p>We prototype different layouts for listing all the projects in one view. But after testing it with other citizens we learn that it was more clear to show them one by one in a card format.</p>

      <h1>Stage 3 | Design Sprint</h1>
      <p>We organize a short <strong>Design Sprint</strong>  with all the team, printed user’s insights and revised the metrics, and each member brainstormed and came up with ideas and solutions based on users feedback.</p>

      <h1>Stage 4 | Wireframing</h1>
      <p>We prioritize new ideas and focused in two features that we could implement in the following sprint: search for things y external sources in timeline.</p>
      <p>Searching for things was an idea suggested by one of our favorite users. Quickly prototyping this helped us get their validation in a super early state. We also share this with other users and asked them to vote too.</p>

      <h1>Stage 5 | Prototyping</h1>
      <p>For prototyping the tabbar animation I choose to use <strong>Principle</strong>, which allow me to manage the acceleration of the curves. Sharing settings with the ios team was easier to match the final version to the prototype.</p>

      <h1>Stage 6 | Release + Communication</h1>
      <p>We finished to define UI objects, developed, tested and sent to Apple, and finally uploaded the new version. This was the first version we release based on user’s feedback and everybody loved it.</p>

      <h1>Learnings | Co-creating with your users</h1>
      <p>Printing user feedback and using it during the brainstorming sessions enriched the process and the final result. This way of working not only reflected positively in the metrics but also in the relation with the users and in the confidence we then had to develop new features.</p>
      <p>From this sprint we began to read about <strong>Open Design</strong> and the idea of co-creating products with the users. It resulted a much more powerful tool that only doing trials with them. Tril is in a way from all of us and they, and it is great to be able to reflect that in the everyday work.</p>
